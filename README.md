# aktiv-student-bachelor

The group was commissioned to develop a web-based platform. Here, students should be able to easily
get in touch with organizations that offer activities in the local community and thus stay
familiar with other students with similar interests. This platform is called «Active
Student".
The project builds on the bachelor thesis of group BO20-G06. The group from last year
created a prototype in Adobe XD on which our group began development.
The website was to be developed via WordPress, a CMS. This is to make the operation of the website
an affordable task for the client, who will take over the platform at the project
end.
A main goal and three sub-goals were set to be achieved during the project. The main goal
was to develop a working solution for "Active Student" which helps to increase
the activity offer for students, and which can help prevent loneliness and isolation
during the study period. The sub-goals were that the platform should be a way to
organizations to attract new members. There should also be an opportunity for students
to find associations and organizations based on the students' own interests. Possibility of
communication between organizations and students should also be implemented.
The platform was developed through the method "flexible" over several iterations, where each
iteration was reviewed with the client.
1st iteration was a minimum product (hereinafter referred to as MVP). Data were retrieved
organizations from the Brønnøysund Register and displayed on the website based on categories. MVP
also contained simple registration forms and profiles.
In the 2nd iteration, sorting based on city was added. Data from the Brønnøysund Register were
cleaned up in, and organizations without a website were filtered out. Registration and profiles
was also improved.
In the final iteration, a list of interests was added to the student profiles so that
students can find like-minded people. Possibility of posting posts from organizational users
was also added.
When the final iteration was completed, the client received an acceptance test
tasks that were to be performed in relation to the operation of the site. All tasks became easy
completed.
The group concludes that a working solution has been developed. It remains
nevertheless some work in relation to user testing, privacy, data security and
marketing before Active Student is ready for launch
